              The Beginning

              Tega and Successâ€™s love story began in the most unexpected of
              places â€” inside a university project handout ðŸ˜‚. Success was eager
              to connect with the team lead, while Tega, the calm and focused
              leader, was determined to guide the project. Their teamwork
              quickly grew into something more meaningful.

                  A simple WhatsApp message about the project soon turned into
                  late-night conversations, filled with laughter, dreams, and
                  warmth.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In each other, they found more than teammates â€” they found
                  balance. Tegaâ€™s calm strength blended with Successâ€™s vibrant
                  energy, and their friendship blossomed into love.

                <p>
                  From study sessions to adventures, their bond only grew
                  stronger. Together, they discovered that life shines brighter
                  when shared.

                  Today, their journey has brought them here: to a love built on
                  trust, respect, and joy, with a promise to walk hand in hand
                  forever.

                  short of magical.

              On a beautiful sunset evening at their favorite hiking spot, Tega
