              The Beginning
            </h3>
            <p className="text-white-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Tega and Successâ€™s love story began in the most unexpected of
              placesâ€”inside a university project handout ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ As fate would have
              it, Success had a tough project in 300L and borrowed a handout
              from a friend. On the front page of the project handout, guess who
              was the lead team? Tega! Success was able to get the team lead's
              number with the zeal and determination to see her project succeed,
              on the other hand Felix stepping up as the group leader. Focused,
              calm, and dedicated, Felix was determined to see the project
              succeed. Success, on the other hand, brought her curiosity,
              warmth, and determination to the table.

              <div className="mt-3 space-y-3">
                <p>
                  One day, Success had a question about the project and decided
                  to send Felix a message on WhatsApp. What seemed like a simple
                  academic chat quickly became the start of something much
                  deeper. Their conversations moved from Tega helping Success
                  meet her project deadlines to late-night talks filled with
                  laughter, shared dreams, and heartfelt moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In each other, they found more than just teammatesâ€”they found
                  balance. Felixâ€™s calm leadership blended perfectly with
                  Successâ€™s vibrant energy. What started as a project blossomed
                  into companionship, friendship, and ultimately, love.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From study sessions to shared adventures, their bond grew
                  stronger with each passing day. They discovered not just how
                  well they worked together, but how much brighter life felt
                  when shared.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, their journey has brought them hereâ€”to a love that
                  feels destined, a partnership built on trust, respect, and
                  joy, and a promise to walk hand in hand forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What began as a school project has become lifeâ€™s greatest
                  project, from schoolmates to soulmates. What we believed to be
                  teamwork in school has now become a perfect love story. Cheers
                  to a marriage filled with love, laughter, and endless
                  adventure.
