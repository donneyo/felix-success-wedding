                         Tega and Successâ€™s love story began in the most unexpected of
                         placesâ€”inside a university project handout ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Success was able to get
                        the team lead's number with the zeal and determination to see her
                        project succeed, on the other hand Tega stepping up as the group leader.
                        Focused, calm, and dedicated, Tega was determined to see the project
                        succeed. Success, on the other hand, brought her curiosity, warmth, and
                        determination to the table.

          <p>
            One day, Success had a question about the project and decided to send
            Felix a message on WhatsApp. What seemed like a simple academic chat
            quickly became the start of something much deeper. Their conversations
            moved from Tega helping Success meet her project deadlines to
            late-night talks filled with laughter, shared dreams, and heartfelt
            moments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In each other, they found more than just teammatesâ€”they found balance.
            Tegaâ€™s calm leadership blended perfectly with Successâ€™s vibrant
            energy. What started as a project blossomed into companionship,
            friendship, and ultimately, love.
          </p>
          <p>
            From study sessions to shared adventures, their bond grew stronger
            with each passing day. They discovered not just how well they worked
            together, but how much brighter life felt when shared.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, their journey has brought them hereâ€”to a love that feels
            destined, a partnership built on trust, respect, and joy, and a
            promise to walk hand in hand forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            What began as a school project has become lifeâ€™s greatest project,
            from schoolmates to soulmates. What we believed to be teamwork in
            school has now become a perfect love story. Cheers to a marriage
            filled with love, laughter, and endless adventure.
